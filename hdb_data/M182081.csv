"Residents comprise Singapore citizens and permanent residents.  Based on mid-year Labour Force Survey except for Census of Population 1990 & 2000 and General Household Surveys 1995 & 2005.  To facilitate comparison with 2008, 2007 Labour Force Survey data have been adjusted based on Singapore Department of Statistics revised population estimates (released in February 2008) which exclude Singapore residents who have been away from Singapore for a continuous period of 12 months or longer.  Data from year 2020 are classified based on Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) 2020 and Singapore Standard Occupational Classification (SSOC) 2020.  Data from 2000 onwards which were coded based on earlier versions of the SSIC and SSOC were mapped to SSIC 2020 and SSOC 2020 respectively as far as possible to facilitate data comparability.  Occupational data are not available for 2006 as the level of occupational detail collected in 2006 did not support mapping.  The level of occupational detail collected in 1990 - 1999 did not support mapping to the latest SSOC 2020 and hence are not strictly comparable to data that were mapped to/coded using SSOC 2020.  Data across the various years may not be strictly comparable due to revisions in the industrial classification.  1991-1994 & 1996-1997 data are based on SSIC 1990.  1998-1999 data are based on SSIC 1996. 1990 and 1995 data are based on SSIC 2005.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Occupation:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Occupation of a working person refers to the kind of work the person was doing during the reference period, which may not necessarily be related to his training, skill or professional qualification. In the case of a person who performs two or more kinds of work, his occupation would refer to the one in which he usually works the longest hours during the reference period. The Singapore Standard Occupational Classification (SSOC) is used to classify working persons by occupation. SSOC 2015 is used to classify the data from 2015 onwards. SS0C 2010 is used to classify working persons for the years 2010 and 2012/13. SSOC 2005 and SSOC 2000 are used to classify the data for the years 2005 and 2000 respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
